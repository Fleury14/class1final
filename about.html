                    <p class="about-bodytext-left">Bowling was not something I got into terribly early, I started bowling mostly becuase my first job was at what is now known as AMF Sierra Lanes in late 1997. Spending a lot of time at the bowling alley meant that I would practice quite a bit before and after shifts. I was quite bad at first, frequently throwing games under 100, but one of the benefits of working at a bowling alley is getting to see some very skilled bowlers for several hours a day, several days a week. I joined my first league a year later, and managed to average in the mid 140s. With enough practice, the average went up every year. Today, I currently carry an average of 218, and have five perfect games (A single game of 300) on record, as well as one 800 series (Totalling a score of 800 in three games.)</p>

                    <p class="about-bodytext-right">Hockey was something that my little sister and I, as well as a good friend of mine decided to get into at the age of 17. I had played roller hockey for a little while and decided to try out playing on ice and I absolutely loved it. I have played in a recreational adult league knows as the FAHL since 1998, aside from taking a break for a few years in the early 2000s. I play defense, and while I'm not terribly good with the puck, I'd like to think that I'm decent enough defensively. I don't score goals very often, and will commit the occasional penalty, but I prioritize defense above all else. </p>

                    <p class="about-bodytext-right">Playing competitive fighting games has been a more recent foray for me. I had always liked fighting games, but didn't realize there was an offline scene for it. Following the release of Street Fighter IV, I noticed a get together for people in Fresno that play the game. Since showing up to my first offline session, I have met some of my closest friends through playing fighting games, and have even attended some large tournament, such as EVO in 2015 and 2016.</p>

In addition to Lucky, who I wrote about on the main page, we have 3 dogs, 4 birds, and too many fish to count. Here's a picture of the three dogs: Horatio on the right, Splinter in the middle, and Nellie on the far right.</p>
